1)What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

Pauses the code running and launches the debugger console at this point.

2)Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No.

3)How do we debug the next line of code?

Debugger option - "step over"

4)What does the step into command do?

Debugger moves into the method on the line and examines it.

5)What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression allows you to run a piece of java code such as a method on a previously declared instance variable. Code fragment evaluation runs multiple pieces of java code in the evaluate expression part of the debugger console, as well as allowing you to create temporary variable in the console to store values.
